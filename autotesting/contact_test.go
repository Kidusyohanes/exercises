	//the tracking fields (.InsertedAt and .UpdatedAt),
	//and verify that the fields were set to the
	//correct values. You can't know *exactly*
	//what those fields will be set to, but if you
	//capture the current time just before you call
	//.SetTrackingData(), and again just after that
	//call returns, you can expect any modified field
	//values to be between those two times.
